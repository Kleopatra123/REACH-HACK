# REACH-HACK
Please help me review and debug the player function, the code is incomplete and the changes there are just me trying to implement reach in the frontend,
please do not mind anything that isnt related to that function , I want to be sure that its going to work before getting on with the remaining, if youre wondering where the 
result would be displayed that would be computed in the backend i.e the reach ,  I'm also working on the reach too so it'll be really nice if you could help me proofread this function 
## THANK YOU
