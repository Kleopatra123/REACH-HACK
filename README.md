<p align="center"> This Project is a number guessing game with a wager 
    <br> 
</p>
The PRICE IS RIGHT is a game where 2 players have to guess the a random number generated by the computer. Here comes the intresting part .....IT COMES WITH A WAGER ,this wager's is implemented using a smart contract, tested and trusted by our great blockchain development platform REACH.
As at the time of this commit the game is still under development although we have a functional reach smart contract and a console based app written in python. NOTE: This is strictly for testing, the main web app would be implemented using html and react js being supported by our Reach Smart Contract for security, fairness and accountability. 

Hat Tips to my able partner, our mentor and our strong discord community.
THANK YOU.
