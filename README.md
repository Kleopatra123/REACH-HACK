<p align="center"> This Project is a number guessing game with a wager 
    <br> 
</p>
Where 2 players have to guess the a random number generated by the computer wait, here comes the intresting part .....IT COMES WITH A WAGER
And this wager smart contract is tested and trusted by our great blockchain development platform REACH
As at of this commit the game is still under development although we have a functional reach smart contract and a console based app written in python 
.NOTE: This is strictly for testing the main web app would be implemented using html and react js working being supported by our Reach Smart Contract for security, fairness and accountability. 

Hat Tips to my able partne, our mentor and our strong discord community.
THANK YOU.
