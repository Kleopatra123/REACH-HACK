### Abstract

<p align="jusified">The Price Is Right is a game where 2 players have to guess the a random number generated by the computer. Here comes the intresting 
part, IT COMES WITH A WAGER ,this wager's is implemented using a smart contract, tested and trusted by our great blockchain development platform Reach. 
  
As at the early development stage we established a functional reach smart contract and a console based app written in python for testing, which we later on built out as a web app using ReactJS, HTML and CSS supported by Reach for security, fairness and accountability. </p>
  
-----------------------------------

 ### Introduction
  
<p align="jusified">This project is the official submission of the Dorathy Kalu Coders Reach team for the Women who code Reach Hackathon. 

This project was built primarily with Reach, a domain-specific language for building Decentralised Applications, Python and ReactJS.</p>
  


### How it works:

- Price is a right is a guessing game with a wager. Two players have the ability to bet on their luck and double their money. 

- Player 1 activates the smart contract and sends an invite to Player 2. 

- Player 2 then accepts the wager and the game begins. 

- Each player has three chances to guess and winner takes all! 

--------------------------------------
The game logic was originally implemented with Reach and Python. 
Then ReactJS was used to build the GUI and front-end. 

Real world applications of the game revolve around its logic and decentralisation. 

- It creates a 100% safe place for 2 people to play a game without fear of being scammed by each other. 

- It is built on the Algorand blockchain so every transaction is lightening fast and there are no extravagant fees. 

- It can also work as a very good escrow, by keeping players wagers fully decentralised and giving autonomy to no one.

--------------------------------

All in all, the Price is Right was a very interesting project to build. Using Reach made it so easy, practical with speedy transactions and compiling time. 

I strongly belive that Reach will revolutionise the development of Decentralised Application.
